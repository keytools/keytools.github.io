Every time you look at the keyboard or make a mistake, you slow down you typing speed. So to be more productive, it would be nice if you could type fast and accurate and this what we will help you do in this website.</p><p>Many apps have been developed to help users improve their typing skills. Our difference with the other applications is that you can improve your typing skills while writing beautiful <b>Quotes</b> and <b>Poems</b> and if you are a Software Engineer like me, you can write <b>Java</b> or <b>Python</b> source code. Another important feature of the site is the ability to view your typing speed and accuracy and how you have improved. Each typing test score will be saved and you can see <a href="/improve-typing-skills-progress.html" target="_blank">graphs of your progress</a>. Last but not least, you can add your own text to type by clicking the <span class="iconify" style="font-size: 2rem" data-icon="akar-icons:plus"></span> icon present in the navbar above.</p><p>The convention on how we should use our keyboard is to put our fingers on the <b>Home Row</b>, the one containing the <b>F</b> and <b>J</b> keys. There are small bumps on these keys and you should put your index fingers on the bumps. Each finger is responsible for its own set of keys, as shown in the image bellow:</p><img id="homeKeysPositionImage" style="margin: 2rem auto 0; display: flex; max-width: 100%"/><p>The majority of people types between 35 and 40 words per minute (WPM) which is equivalent to 190 and 200 characters per minute (CPM). However, professional typists type a lot faster exceeding 75 WPM. Typing speed generally improves with practice. While practicing, it is important to ensure that there are no weak keys. Typing speed is typically determined by how slow these weak keys are typed rather than how fast the remaining keys are typed. That's why it is advisable to start by our <b>Training lessons</b> to memorize keys position. By default, the <b>Qwerty keyboard</b> is selected and if you are using <b>Azerty keyboard</b>, you can change your preferences to obtain the adequate lessons.</p></div></div></div><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-J50L9ZPB46"></script><script>window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
